Automatic forecasting with exponential smoothing
The namesake function for finding errors, trend, and seasonality (ETS) provides a completely 
automatic way of producing forecasts for a wide range of time series.

data %>% ets() %>% foreast() %>% autoplot()

simple exponential smoothing
# Use ses() to forecast the next 10 years of winning times
fc <- ses(marathon, h = 10)

# Use summary() to see the model parameters
summary(fc)

# Use autoplot() to plot the forecasts
autoplot(fc)

# Add the one-step forecasts for the training data to the plot
autoplot(fc) + autolayer(fitted(fc))

Global Stat- Are the relationships between your X predictors and Y roughly linear?. Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates a non-linear relationship between one or more of your Xâ€™s and Y

Skewness - Is your distribution skewed positively or negatively, necessitating a transformation to meet the assumption of normality? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that you should likely transform your data.

Kurtosis- Is your distribution kurtotic (highly peaked or very shallowly peaked), necessitating a transformation to meet the assumption of normality? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that you should likely transform your data.

Link Function- Is your dependent variable truly continuous, or categorical? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that you should use an alternative form of the generalized linear model (e.g. logistic or binomial regression).

Heteroscedasticity- Is the variance of your model residuals constant across the range of X (assumption of homoscedastiity)? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that your residuals are heteroscedastic, and thus non-constant across the range of X. Your model is better/worse at predicting for certain ranges of your X scales.
